## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a minor character (a baker, a scribe, a bath attendant) observes Aquila and interprets his actions through the lens of their own constrained life.
- Expand on the 'Brotherhood of the Bean'—who are they, what is their ritual, and what philosophy binds them?
- Create a flashback scene to Aquila and Favonianus at the 'Bridge of Sorrows,' exploring the moment the debt of blood was incurred.
- Write a monologue from the primary antagonist explaining their view of freedom and control, making their rationale compelling.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Rome (Viminal Hill, Subura, Emporium) tracking Aquila's movements and the key locations of the conspiracy.
- Create a 'Constraint Engine' narrative tool that generates story branches based on character debts (blood, coin, honour) and the social layers of Roman society.
